PDDL Artificial Intelligence 

This program was developed by Hermes Valenciano, Marti Homs and me (Marc Benedi) for the artificial intelligence course at Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya.

It creates menus (first and second plate).

This are the levels of complexity:
* Basic level: It creates a weekly menu where the plates are compatible between them.
* Extension 1: One plate is not used more than one time per week.
* Extension 2: There are no two consecutive days with the same type of food.
* Extension 3: There are certain plates that have to be in a day.
* Extension 4: The generated menus have between 1000 cal and 1500 cal.
* Extension 5: The planificator minimizes the price of the menus.

Unfortunatelly, the last 3 extensions doesn't work. We don't know if the program finishes or not.
